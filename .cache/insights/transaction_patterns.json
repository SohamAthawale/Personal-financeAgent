This suggests a pattern of frequent and repeated transactions on the same date.\n\n2. High-Level Behavioral Patterns:\n   - There is a frequent use of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) for both receiving and sending payments.\n   - The transactions are clustered around specific senders such as \"MAHENDRA KUMAR\" and \"JITENDRAKUMAR,\" indicating repeated interactions with these individuals or entities."
