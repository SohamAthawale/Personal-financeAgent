Misc Businesses (1459.81)\n\nThese two categories still account for approximately 64% of total expenses.\n\n**Discretionary vs Fixed Categories:**\n\n* Discretionary: Food, Shopping, and Misc Businesses\n\t+ These categories are discretionary because they can be adjusted or reduced without significantly impacting daily life.\n* Fixed: Transport, Medical\n\t+ These categories are fixed because they are essential for basic needs (transportation) or health (medical expenses).\n\n**Practical Optimization Suggestion:**\n\nThe spending structure remains stable, and the dominant categories are still Food and Misc Businesses. The suggestion to focus on reducing Food expenses remains a priority, as it has the potential for significant optimization.\n\nNo changes in category dominance, risk profile, or discretionary mix have occurred, so the spending structure is considered stable."
