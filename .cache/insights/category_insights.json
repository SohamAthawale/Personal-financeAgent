  "content": "Based on the updated category totals:\n\n1. **Top Spending Categories:**\n   - Food: $24,191.82\n   - Shopping: $7,097.84\n\n2. **Discretionary vs Fixed Categories:**\n   - Discretionary:\n     - Food\n     - Shopping\n     - Subscriptions\n     - Transport\n     - Medical\n     - Misc Businesses\n   - Fixed:\n     - Investments/Mandates\n     - Bills\n\n3. **Practical Optimization Suggestion:**\nGiven the updated data, there are notable changes in the spending categories:\n\n- **Food** has significantly increased to $24,191.82.\n- **Shopping** remains as a top category at $7,097.84.\n\nThe risk profile now shows that \"Food\" is still the highest discretionary spending category, which was not previously the case. This increase in \"Food\" spending could indicate potential areas for optimization or monitoring to ensure it does not become unsustainable.\n\nThe spending structure has changed significantly with \"Food\" becoming the dominant discretionary category. It is crucial to closely monitor this category for any unexpected increases and consider strategies to manage these expenses effectively.\n\nIn summary, the spending structure remains unstable due to the significant increase in \"Food\" spending, which continues to pose a new risk profile."
